## Introduction

Stratum is a simple but versatile website theme written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project came about when I decided that I wanted to test my front-end skills by coding a website theme from scratch. I think it's turned out to be pretty decent!

The theme is currently available in flat-file format and as a [Grav](https://getgrav.org) theme. Visit Stratum's [Grav theme repository](https://github.com/j3kennard/grav-theme-stratum) to revamp your Grav site's look and feel!

## Installation

It's as easy as downloading or cloning the repository into your web root:

```
$ cd /var/www
$ git clone https://github.com/j3kennard/theme-stratum.git
```
